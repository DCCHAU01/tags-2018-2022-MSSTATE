1. List the contact methods found in the Contact table. For each contact method, list how 
many people chose that contact method.
2. Repeat the query from #1 but divide the results by language. The language attribute in the 
Contact table uses ISO 639-1 codes (en = English, es = Spanish, etc.). It is expected that 
your groups will consist of the 2-character language codes.
3. Find the people in the Contact table whose preferred name is not the same as the first 
letters of their first name. For each person, list their name (first name, middle initial, and 
last name) and their preferred name.
Examples: Joseph (preferred name: Joe) would be in the results. Josephine (preferred 
name: Jo) would not be in the results.
4. Find the people in the Contact table that are more than 60 years old. For each person, list 
their name (first name, middle initial, and last name), birthdate, and contact method. Sort 
the results by birthdate in ascending order.
5. How many people did not provide a phone number or an email address?
6. List the people who appear in either the Bluetooth or GPS data. For each person, list their 
name (first name, middle initial, and last name). Order the results by last name.
7. List the people who appear in neither the Bluetooth nor the GPS data. For each person, 
list their name (first name, middle initial, and last name). Order the results by last name.
8. Calculating close contacts via GPS coordinates is fairly difficult. As a first step, find each 
person that is located at the same GPS coordinates for at least 15 consecutive minutes. 
Print a list of CIDs along with GPS coordinates ordered by GPS coordinates.
9. Who would be considered close contacts based on the Bluetooth data? List the CIDs in 
pairs for people that are recorded as close for at least 15 consecutive minutes.
