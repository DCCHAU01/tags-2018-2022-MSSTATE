Note: I read through robot.txt and modified the repository name to prevent this repository from showing up on search engines. <br />
      If you are here, either I gave out the link or you personally know of me from somewhere. <br />
I heard/read that GitHub can be considered part of a resume or portfolio, so here it is.<br />
Contains the coding assignments I did during my University(2018-2022) days.<br />
Coded with: Python, C, C++, and MySQL<br />
Caution: during the start of each semester, I often made mistakes.  Compile and run my university assignments at your own risk.<br />
On the bright side, only the first few programs of each semester may have these errors.<br />
I usually learned from those errors so later programs scored highly or completely.<br />
