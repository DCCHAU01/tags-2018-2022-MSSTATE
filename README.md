# tags-My-Uni-Assignments
Contains a portion of the assignments I did during my time in University(2018-2022): C, C++, Python, SQL.<br />
Things I did not include: Code for University Exams, some Homework, some Assignments, PIC24 Assembly, MIPS Assembly, and trying other things(PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Command Line). <br />

Note: I read through robot.txt and modified the repository name to prevent this repository from showing up on search engines. <br />
