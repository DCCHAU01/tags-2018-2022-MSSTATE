# tags-My-Uni-Assignments
I read that GitHub is necessary for job searching these days, so here I am.<br />
Contains the coding assignments I did during my University(2018-2022) days.<br />
Coded with: Python, C, C++, and MySQL<br />
Caution: during the start of each semester, I often made mistakes.  Compile and run my university assignments at your own risk.<br />
On the bright side, only the first few files of each semester have these errors.<br />
I usually learned from those errors so later files scored highly or completely.<br />
