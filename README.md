# tags-My-Uni-Assignments
Contains the coding assignments I did during my University(2018-2022) days.<br />
Python, C, C++, and MySQL<br />
Caution: during the start of each semester, I often made mistakes.  Compile and run my university assignments at your own risk.<br />
On the bright side, only the first few files of each semester have these errors.<br />
I usually corrected those errors so later implementations scored highly or completely.<br />
