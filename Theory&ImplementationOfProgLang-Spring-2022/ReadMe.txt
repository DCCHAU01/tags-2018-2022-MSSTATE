Theory and Implementation of Programming Languages Spring 2022
In this course, I worked on this project in stages.
The files here are the final stage/product.
I uploaded this code as proof of work.
The files needed for compilation do not belong to me so I did not upload them.

This program is meant to:
  Identify lexemes and return a token.
  Take those tokens and parse based on grammar rules.
  Construct a parse tree.
  Interpret the instructions in the parse tree.
